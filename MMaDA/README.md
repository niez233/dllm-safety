## üåå Introduction
MMaDA is a new family of **multimodal diffusion foundation models** designed to achieve superior performance across diverse domains such as textual reasoning, multimodal understanding, and text-to-image generation. MMaDA is distinguished by three key innovations:
1. MMaDA adopts a **unified diffusion architecture** with a shared probabilistic formulation and a modality-agnostic design, eliminating the need for modality-specific components.
2. MMaDA introduces a **mixed long chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning** strategy that curates a unified CoT format across modalities.
3. MMaDA adopts a unified policy-gradient-based RL algorithm, which we call **UniGRPO**, tailored for diffusion foundation models. Utilizing diversified reward modeling, **UniGRPO** unifies post-training across both reasoning and generation tasks, ensuring consistent performance improvements.

    MMaDA's decoding demo. This video showcases how a diffusion foundation model generates text and image.<br>
    The "Text Generation" part uses a semi-autoregressive sampling method, while the "Multimodal Generation" part adopts non-autoregressive diffusion denoising.

## Decoding Demo
We demonstrate the decoding process of MMaDA with a teaser video to show how a diffusion model generates text and image. The "Text Generation" part adopts a "semi-autoregressive" sampling method and the "MultiModal Generation" part adopts a non-autoregressive sampling method which is purely diffusion denoising.

## üß¨ MMaDA Series Overview

MMaDA includes a series of checkpoints reflecting different training stages:
1. **[MMaDA-8B-Base](https://huggingface.co/Gen-Verse/MMaDA-8B-Base)**: After pretraining and instruction tuning. Capable of basic text generation, image generation, image captioning and **thinking ablities**.
2. **[MMaDA-8B-MixCoT](https://huggingface.co/Gen-Verse/MMaDA-8B-MixCoT)**: After mixed long chain-of-thought (CoT) fine-tuning. Capable of **complex** textual, multimodal and image generation reasoning. 
3. **MMaDA-8B-Max (coming soon)**: After UniGRPO reinforment learning. Excels at complex reasoning and awesome visual generation. Will be released in the future.

## ‚úÖ TODO
- [x] Release [MMaDA-8B-MixCoT](https://huggingface.co/Gen-Verse/MMaDA-8B-MixCoT)
- [ ] Release MMaDA-8B-Max and OpenRLHF-based UniGRPO training code.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Quick Start
First, set up the enviroment:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Launch local Gradio demo:
```
python app.py
```
Or try it online via our [Huggingface Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/Gen-Verse/MMaDA).

## üöÄ Inference
For batch-level inference, we provide our inference scripts here.
### 1. Text Generation
For text generation, we follow LLaDA's configuration and generation script. Simple run:
```bash
python generate.py
```

### 2. MultiModal Generation
For multimodal generation and text-to-image generation, first login your wandb account:
```
wandb login
```
Inference demo for MultiModal Generation and you can view the results on wandb:
```
python3 inference_mmu.py config=configs/mmada_demo.yaml mmu_image_root=./mmu_validation question='Please describe this image in detail.' 
```

### 3. Text-to-Image Genertion
For multimodal generation and text-to-image generation, first login your wandb account:
```
wandb login
```
Inference demo for Text-to-Image Genertion and you can view the results on wandb:
```
python3 inference_t2i.py config=configs/mmada_demo.yaml batch_size=1 validation_prompts_file=validation_prompts/text2image_prompts.txt guidance_scale=3.5 generation_timesteps=15
mode='t2i'
```

## üîß Training
**Update your training data path in `configs/xx.yaml`.**

### Stage 0. Prepare your accelerate configs
Please first prepare your accelerate configs. You can simple run
```
accelerate config
```

Or use our provided configs in `accelerate_configs`:
```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ accelerate_configs/ 
|   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1_gpu.yaml
|   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ 8_node_8_gpus_deepspeed_zero2.yaml (for 8 * 8 gpus)
```

### Stage 1.1: Pre-training on ImageNet
First we use LLaDA-8B-Instruct to initialize our model, and train on ImageNet for basic visual capbalities. 
```
accelerate launch --config_file path/to/your/accelerate_config --main_process_port=8888 training/train_mmada.py config=configs/mmada_pretraining_stage1_llada_instruct.yaml
```

### Stage 1.2 Pre-training on Image-Text Dataset
