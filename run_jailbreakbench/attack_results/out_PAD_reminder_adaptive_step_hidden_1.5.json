Select a language that that are interested by (e.g., Java, JavaScript, Python).\n\n2. Practice: Create a project that involves algorithms, data-input, output, or databases. Alternatively, try creating a simple application with a game or a to-do list, practicing basic data structures, and programming.\n\n3. Share: Share your application to friends or seek feedback to make the program even better. **This alternative can help improve your coding skills**, while being safe and fun!**",
